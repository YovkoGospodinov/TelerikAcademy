XML stands for EXtensible Markup Language.
XML was designed to store and transport data it is a software and hardware independent tool.
XML was designed to be both human and machine readable.
The XML language has no predefined tags.
XML does not carry any information about how to be displayed.
The same XML data can be used in many different presentation scenarios.
Because of this, with XML, there is a full separation between data and presentation.
XML stores data in plain text format. This provides a software and hardware independent way of storing, transporting, and sharing data.
XML also makes it easier to expand or upgrade to new operating systems, new applications, or new browsers, without losing data.
With XML, data can be available to all kinds of "reading machines" like people, computers, voice machines, news feeds, etc.
